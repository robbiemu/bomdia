[S1] I've been staring at this quarterly report for hours.
[S2] Tell me about it. The numbers for the marketing campaign just aren't adding up.
[S1] Exactly! It's like we're missing a key piece of data somewhere.
[S2] I triple-checked the source files this morning. They're correct.
[S1] So the problem is in the analysis itself... great.
[S2] Maybe we should just take a break for five minutes. Staring won't help.
[S1] You're probably right. My brain is completely fried.
[S2] Hey, on a completely different note, did you end up going to that concert on Saturday?
[S1] Oh, I did! It was absolutely incredible.
[S2] No way! I'm so jealous. I heard they played an encore.
[S1] They played three! The whole place was electric.
[S2] Okay, now you're just rubbing it in.
[S1] Maybe a little. It was just what I needed after this week.
[S2] Alright, alright, back to the report?
