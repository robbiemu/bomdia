Alex: I've been staring at this quarterly report for hours.
Ben: Tell me about it. The numbers for the marketing campaign just aren't adding up.
Alex: Exactly! It's like we're missing a key piece of data somewhere.
Ben: I triple-checked the source files this morning. They're correct.
Alex: So the problem is in the analysis itself... great.
Ben: Maybe we should just take a break for five minutes. Staring won't help.
Alex: You're probably right. My brain is completely fried.
Ben: Hey, on a completely different note, did you end up going to that concert on Saturday?
Alex: Oh, I did! It was absolutely incredible.
Ben: No way! I'm so jealous. I heard they played an encore.
Alex: They played three! The whole place was electric.
Ben: Okay, now you're just rubbing it in.
Alex: Haha, maybe a little. It was just what I needed after this week.
Ben: Alright, alright, back to the report?
