    Test to verify that network calls are properly mocked in our test suite.

    # This is a placeholder test - in practice, you would run your full test suite
    # with network blocking enabled to ensure no real calls are made

    # Example of how you could run tests with network blocking:
    # pytest --disable-socket tests/

    # For now, we'll just verify that our mocking approach works
    assert True  # Placeholder assertion
